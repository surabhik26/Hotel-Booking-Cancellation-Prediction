project:
  name: "Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction"
  description: >
    Developed a machine learning model to predict hotel booking cancellations 
    using historical reservation data. Applied data preprocessing, feature 
    engineering, and Random Forest classifier. Evaluated model with accuracy, 
    precision, and recall to help hotels reduce last-minute cancellations.
